==1. How do I save the cropped image?==
The JavaScript Image Cropper UI is simply a JavaScript interface to allow a user to select the area of an image they wish to crop. Physically cropping and saving the image is beyond the abilities of JavaScript and should be performed server side, this usually works in the following process:

  # User uploads image
  # Cropper is displayed
  # User selects area to crop and submits a form
  # Server crops and saves the image (may also resize - e.g. for a fixed size avatar)
  # Present user with the cropped and saved image

There are some 3rd party server side implementations that work with the JavaScript Image Cropper:
